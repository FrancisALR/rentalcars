# Rental Cars Assessment

Uses Maven for compiling the jar's that have been used: spark and gson

## Part 1
Run the JsonParser.java file to see results

## Part 2
Run the Service.java file to see results

## Notes
Issues with .jar files mean it is easier to run service.java and jsonparse.java rather than the compiled .jar file. 

## Limitations
Output through Spark REST api is not configured to give output in a visually appealing way and only gives results in toString format. With more time the functions that are used in the console side to format the output would need to be tailored to be able to be used with Spark.
